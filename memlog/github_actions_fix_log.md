# GitHub Actions Fix Log

## Issue Encountered
**Date:** 2025-06-13  
**Time:** 16:24 HKT  
**Error:** Exit code 128 - Permission denied

## Problem Analysis
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with this error:
```
remote: Permission to ZorroCheng-MC/EMSDdoc.git denied to github-actions[bot].
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/ZorroCheng-MC/EMSDdoc/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

## Root Cause
The workflow was successfully:
1. ✅ Converting DOCX to Markdown (`test.md` was created successfully)
2. ✅ Committing the changes locally
3. ❌ **FAILING** when trying to push changes back to the repository

**Why:** GitHub Actions didn't have permission to push changes to the repository.

## Solution Applied
Added the missing `permissions` section to the workflow file:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write  # Allow workflow to push changes back to repository
```

## Technical Details
- **GitHub Actions Default:** By default, GitHub Actions has read-only access
- **Required Permission:** `contents: write` permission is needed to push changes
- **Security Note:** This is a standard GitHub security feature to prevent unauthorized modifications

## Fix Status
- ✅ **Fixed:** Commit `98093a3` - "Fix GitHub Actions permissions - add contents: write permission"
- ✅ **Deployed:** Successfully pushed to repository
- ✅ **Ready for Testing:** Workflow should now work correctly

## Next Steps for User
1. Test the workflow by adding/modifying a DOCX file
2. Push the changes to trigger the workflow
3. Verify that the workflow completes successfully and the MD file is auto-committed

## Lesson Learned
Always include appropriate permissions in GitHub Actions workflows that need to modify repository content.
